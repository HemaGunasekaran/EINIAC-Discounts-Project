# EINIAC Discounts Data Analysis Project  
**DataScience Bootcamp Project — WBS Coding School**

This project is a part of my studies at the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School, focusing on using SQL and analytical skills to derive insights from real-world data.

## Objective:
To analyze the effectiveness and impact of product discounting strategies at EINIAC and determine whether discounting is beneficial in terms of sales and revenue generation.

## Summary:
As part of WBS's learning curriculum, this project aimed to assess how discounts influence customer purchases and profitability. The challenge was to dig into EINIAC’s sales data and determine when and where discounting adds value.

## Details:
EINIAC is a marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. The company wanted to explore how discounts affect sales across different product types and price segments. We focused our analysis on:

- The proportion of revenue from discounted vs. non-discounted products
- Revenue generation by product price categories
- Brand-based revenue concentration
- The seasonality of discounts and their impact on sales
- Discount levels across product segments

## Tools Used:
- MySQL: For querying and aggregating raw data.
- PowerPoint / Google Slides: For presenting key insights and recommendations.

## Datasource:
Internal EINIAC transactional and product data, provided as part of the Bootcamp project case.

## Project Contributors:
Individual project completed as part of the WBS Coding School curriculum.

## Key Learnings:
- Analyzing discount performance across product categories and timeframes
- Interpreting seasonality and customer behavior from sales trends
- Data aggregation and slicing by brand, price, and discount levels
- Making data-driven recommendations based on business objectives

## Challenges Overcome:
- Distinguishing meaningful trends within high-volume sales data
- Balancing profitability with competitive pricing in recommendations
- Categorizing brand perception and strategic pricing from raw data

## Recommendations:
- Keep moderate discounts (up to 30%) for high-value products
- Avoid heavy discounts on premium segments
- Shift focus from low-value items to high-revenue generators
- Utilize seasonal spikes like Black Friday and Christmas to boost sales
- Avoid over-discounting to maintain brand value and profitability

## Conclusion:
Discounting at EINIAC can be a powerful tool when used strategically. Moderate, well-timed discounts on premium and high-value items yield significant returns. Our analysis supports a data-driven discounting strategy that enhances both competitiveness and profitability.
